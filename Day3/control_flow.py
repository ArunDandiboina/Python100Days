# python executes from top to bottom.
# this is simple and we can write simple algorithms. (LIMITED)

# Control flow statements alter this sequential execution by

# like, if else, for, while, try except, and many more.

# they are instructions to computer to execute our way.
# good code = datastructures + algorithms
# readable and scalable code(space and time).
