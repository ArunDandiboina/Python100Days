Revision - from 1 to 16 days.

Programming - giving instrution to the computer.

Good Code - Readable + Scalable
program - Datastructures + Algorithm.

Python - High-Level, Object-Oriented.

Variable - a named location - reference to the memory.
naming rules - _ and alphabets start, readable (deec),
snake_case, CamelCase, Uppercase(const)


Datatypes - type of data in cpu(ram)
good code - readable, scalable(space and time)

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:	NoneType

Different datatypes.
str, int

In python we can't add int and str
use format or f-strings.

expression - evaluates to value - store
statements - instrutions to computer.

expression - operators
Arthematic, Logical, Assignment, Binary, Comparision
Operators - PEMDAS.

Control flow statements alter this sequential execution by
enabling make decisions, repeat actions, and handle errors. 
like, if else, for, while, try except, and many more.

Datastructures - lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets.
The way we orginize data in comp(ram) to access in effecient.


1 2 3 4 .... BROAD
print, decisions, loops, funcs, class, modules, packages...
Software.

Built-in modules - random

if elif else nested - block of code executes when true

for - iterate to n times. iterate through iterables.

while - runs until the condition remains true.


function - A block of reusable code 
that performs a specific task.


Lists - Sequence datatype, [1,3,4]
Dictionary - key value - {1: 1, 2: 2}


while - for games, hashmaps(Dictionary) for decreasing time.

Debugging - process of removing the bug.

OOP - paradigm that uses objects
to model real-world entities and their interactions.

Object - Blueprint of Class
